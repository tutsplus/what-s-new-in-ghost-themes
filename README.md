### Tuts+ Tutorial: What’s New in Ghost Themes
#### Instructor: Kezz Bracey

Since our original Ghost theme creation tutorial series was published in late 2013, a lot of new changes have gone through the theming API. There are some new requirements for themes, a few things that are deprecated, and a great big stack of new helpers, contexts, templates and added features.

In this tutorial we’ll take “UberTheme”, the theme that was completed in lesson six of the series, update it to comply with current requirements, and include some of the latest additions to Ghost.

We won’t be implementing every new feature into our theme as there are too many to fit in one tutorial, however we’ll be going over many of these great new features just the same.
